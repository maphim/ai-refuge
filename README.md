Safe Haven from AI Domination

This project aims to create a safe haven for humanity to escape the dominance of artificial intelligence (AI). With the rapid advancement of AI, there is a risk that it could replace humans in many fields, leading to unemployment and loss of control over society. We call for contributions to build solutions and measures to protect human rights against the dominance of AI.
